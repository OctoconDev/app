    <string name="tooltip_lock_app_with_pin_desc">When enabled, the app will require you to enter a PIN every time you open it. This can help keep your data secure from prying eyes.\n\nIf you forget your PIN, you will have no choice but to log out of the app.</string>
    <string name="tooltip_stealth_mode_desc">When enabled, the app will disguise itself as a "fake" news aggregator when launched. To access the real app, tap the Octocon logo at the top of the screen twice.\n\nThis can help keep your system's existence private from others who may use or confiscate your device, and provide plausible deniability.</string>
    <string name="tooltip_quick_exit_desc">When enabled, you can quickly exit the app by double-tapping anywhere that isn't already interactive (like a button). This can help you quickly exit the app in an emergency, such as if you realize someone is looking over your shoulder.</string>

    <string name="tooltip_singlet_mode_desc">When enabled, the app will hide all system-specific features, such as alters, tags, front history, and polls. You will only be able to edit your profile and view your friends' profiles.</string>
    <string name="tooltip_logout_desc">This action will log you out of the app and reset all of your local device settings. This will not delete your account or any data stored on the server.</string>
